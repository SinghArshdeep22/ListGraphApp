# ListGraphApp - List and Graph Data Structure Implementation

ListGraphApp is a Windows Forms application designed to demonstrate the implementation of generic list and graph data structures. It provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing lists of integers or strings and graphs with nodes containing integer or string values. 

## Features
- **List Management:** Allows users to perform CRUD operations on lists of integers or strings.
- **Graph Management:** Enables users to create, modify, and traverse graphs with nodes containing integer or string values. Supports BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) traversal algorithms.
- **Import and Export:** Provides functionality to import lists or graphs from formatted strings or files, and export them back to strings or files for data persistence.
- **Node Counting:** Allows counting nodes in a list or graph based on specific criteria, such as counting nodes divisible by a certain number.
- **Node Value Operations:** Supports operations such as finding the sum of values of all nodes or finding the longest string reachable from a specific node in a graph.

## Requirements
- .NET Framework or .NET Core
- Windows Forms
- Visual Studio (or another compatible IDE)
